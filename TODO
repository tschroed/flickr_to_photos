Structure and testing:
- There are a coupl of places where the flickr client touches the
  module-scoped oauth client, but it should be relatively easy to fix.
- Create an injectable mock or fake to stick in the client for
  testing.

Flickr sync:
- Not-in-set must be special cased
- Get videos
- DON'T FORGET FLICKR TAGS!
- Remember favorites

Picasa sync:
- Use metadata from filesystem or require live sync from Flickr each time?
- Start small. Pick a photoset with < 10 images.
- Create an album and tag with an appropriate from_flickr or whatever keyword
- Be sure to set the slug
- Bail if the album already exists?
  -- Maybe go into a deep-sync mode where we check which photos are
     actually in the album and upload any that are missing.
