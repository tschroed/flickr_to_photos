- Pull down the list of sets and not-in-set photos
- Farm out the list of sets to worker goroutines over a channel
- Each thread makes a directory for the set and dumps a json of the metadata
- Not-in-set must be special cased
- Each thread pulls down a list of photos and writes them to a channel
- The work order will be the photo metadata and a destination directory
- A set of worker goroutines pulls photos off the channel and
  downloads them, then writes out the metadata
- Work will be skipped if it's already been performed.
